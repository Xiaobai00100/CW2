Hi, I will introduce the dataset BenefitsCostSharing.csv that we will explore and analyse together in this project.

The BenefitsCostSharing.csv file is part of the Health Insurance Marketplace dataset published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  This dataset is a collection of detailed records pertaining to health and dental plans provided through the U.S. Health Insurance Marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
